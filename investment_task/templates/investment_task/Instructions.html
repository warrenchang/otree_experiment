        <p > In this task you can use <strong>part of your show-up fee, AED 20</strong>, to make an investment decision.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Option A:
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In Option A, you can invest the portion of this amount, and keep the rest of the money.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <p>
                If the investment succeeds, you receive 3 times the amount invested.
                <br/>
                If the investment fails, you lose the amount you invested.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            There is an equal chance that the investment will fail or succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you decide to invest 0, then you will keep all the AED 20 as your payoff.
            If you decide to invest all your AED 20, then there is a 50% chance that you receive AED 60,
            but also a 50% chance that you lose all the AED 20 and receive nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to invest AED 8, then there is a 50% chance that the investment is successful
            and you receive 12 + 3 x 8 =  AED 36,
            but also a 50% chance that you lose all the AED 8 and only get AED 12.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Option B:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose Option B, you need to invest all the AED 20.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <p>
                If the investment succeeds, you receive AED 75.
                <br/>
                If the investment fails, you lose all the AED 20.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            There is a 40% chance that the investment succeeds, and a 60% chance that the investment fails.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            <strong>
                How do we determine whether the investment is a success?
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            After you chose which option you want to invest and (for Option A) how much you wish to invest,
            you can click the button "check the investment", and the computer will randomly generate a number
            between 1 and 10 with equal probability.
            <br/>
            For Option A:
            <br/>
            If the random number is greater than 5, you earn 3 times the amount you chose to invest;
            otherwise you lose the amount you chose to invest.
            <br/>
            For Option B:
            <br/>
            If the random number is greater than 6, you earn AED 75; otherwise you lose the investment.
        </p>
