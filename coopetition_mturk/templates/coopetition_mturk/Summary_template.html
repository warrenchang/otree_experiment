    <strong><u>Summary of the Situation</u></strong>
</p>
<div>
    <p>
        In each round, you receive 10 points.
        You need to decide the number of points put into an <strong>Investment Account</strong> (\(x_1\)) and a <strong>Rationing Account</strong> (\(y_1\)).
        The rest of the points (\(10-x_1-y_1\)) are kept to yourself.
    </p>

            Your final earnings can be expressed as
            $$\text{Final Earnings} =  \underbrace{\frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2}x_1 x_2}_{\text{earnings from the investment}} +
            \underbrace{10-x_1-y_1}_{\text{points kept for oneself}}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, putting more points in the <i>Investment Account</i> (a higher \(x_1\))  <strong>generates a higher total return</strong>
        , while putting more points in the <i>Rationing Account</i> (a higher \(y_1\)) <strong>increases your share of the total return</strong>.
