           You are just matched with another participant, and you will start to interact with this participant to earn some money.

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Note: The experiment proceeds as fast as the slower participant.
        If both participants make prompt decisions quickly, the experiment can be finished quickly.
        Therefore, please keep focused and submit your decisions in a timely manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to make sure that the experiment does not take forever, we impose some time limit for the decision-making.
        For the first 5 rounds, you have 1 minutes to reach your decision; after Round 5, you have 30 seconds to reach your decision.
        <strong>If you do not submit your answer within the allocated time, the computer will randomly choose answers for you, and
            you will not get paid for that round.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        <strong>Remember to submit once you reach your decision.
            Your decision is submitted only after you click "Submit".</strong>
