        <strong> Please wait for the system to match you with another participant... </strong>
    </p>
<p>
        You are being matched with another participant to continue with the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you successfully complete the experiment, you will for sure receive $1 as  your payment.
        Depending on your and the other participant's decision, you can also earn up to $5 as additional bonus for the rest
        of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the rare event that the system cannot find a matching for you because there are not enough participants,
        you are still guaranteed to be paid by $1. If you are not matched with another participant in 5 minutes,
        you can close the browser and leave the experiment. A $1 will be paid to you later.

    During your interaction with the other participant, the following experimental interface will be
    shown for you to submit your decisions.

<p style="font-size:16px">
    Note:
    The experiment proceeds as fast as the slower participant, so please submit your decisions in a prompt manner.
    For the first 5 rounds, you have 1 minutes to reach your decision; after Round 5, you have 30 seconds to reach your decision.
    <strong>If you do not submit your answer within the allocated time, the computer will randomly choose answers for you, and
        you will not get paid for that round.</strong> If you fail to submit your decisions too many times, you will be
    able to receive your experimental payment.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
    <strong>Remember to submit once you reach your decision.
        Your decision is submitted only after you click "Submit".</strong>
