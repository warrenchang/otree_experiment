Introduction: Part 2

<p>
    This is the start of Part 2 of the experiment.
    In this part, there will be 10 rounds of decision-making.
    You will be matched with <strong>the same participant</strong> as in Part I.
</p>
<p>
The situation in Part 2 is quite similar to Part 1. This part differs from Prat 1 only in that

    <strong>the total return from the investment now is \(x_1x_2+60\)</strong> instead of \(x_1x_2\).
    That is, the total return from the investment is 60 points more than before.

        </strong> instead of
    \(\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}\).
    That is, the total return is \(2x_1x_2+60\) points if the investment is a success, and 60 points if the investment is a failure.
    The total return from the investment is therefore 60 points more than before, whether the investment is a success or not.

    <strong>the total return from the investment now is

    That is, the total return is \(2x_1x_2\) points if the investment is a success, and 0 point if the investment is a failure.

    The total return from the investment is therefore 60 points less than before, whether the investment is a success or not.

    That is, the total return is 260 points if the investment is a success, and 60 points if the investment is a failure.
    The total return from the investment is therefore 60 points more than before, whether the investment is a success or not.

    That is, the total return is 200 points if the investment is a success, and 0 point if the investment is a failure.
    The total return from the investment is therefore 60 points less than before, whether the investment is a success or not.
