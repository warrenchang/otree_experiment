    {% if player.receiver1 == "farmer" %}
    Farmworkers, who are exposed to the sun for many hours, have a higher rate of skin cancer than the general population.
    Frequent medical check-ups can reduce the risk. A fund will be set up to support medical check-ups for threatened groups.
    How much (DKK) would you contribute to this fund?
    {% endif%}
    {% if player.receiver1 == "dolphin" %}
    Dolphins in many breeding locations are threatened by pollution, which is expected to result in a decline of the dolphin population.
     A special fund supported by private contributions has been set up to provide pollution-free breeding locations for dolphins.
    How much (DKK) would you contribute to this fund?
