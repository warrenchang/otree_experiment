<p>
    Before the end of the experiment, you will finish one last simple task to earn additional money.
</p>
<p>
    In this task, you will select one gamble from seven different gambles shown below.
    Each gamble has two possible outcomes (Event A or Event B), and each event has a 50% chance of occurring.
</p>
<p>
    Your earnings for this part of the study will be determined by:  1) which of the five gambles you select;
    and 2) which of the two possible events occur.
</p>

    For example:
<ul>
    <li>
        If you select Gamble 2 and Event A occurs, you will earn {{ Constants.outcomesA.1 }} points.
        If Event B occurs, you will earn {{ Constants.outcomesB.1 }} points.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you select Gamble 5 and Event A occurs, you will earn {{ Constants.outcomesA.4 }} points.
        If Event B occurs, you will earn {{ Constants.outcomesB.4 }} points.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To determine which event occurs, after you have made your decision, the computer randomly generate a number from 1 to 10, with equal probability.
    If the number is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, then event A occurs.
    If the number is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, then event B occurs.
</p>

<table class="table" style="text-align:center">
    <tr> <td> Gambles </td> <td> Event A <br/>(when the random number is 1,2,3,4,5)</td> <td> Event B <br/>(when the random number is 6,7,8,9,10)</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.0 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.0 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.0 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.1 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.1 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.1 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.2 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.2 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.2 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.3 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.3 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.3 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.4 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.4 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.4 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.5 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.5 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.5 }} points</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{{ form.choice.6 }}</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesA.6 }} points</td><td>{{ Constants.outcomesB.6 }} points</td></tr>
</table>
