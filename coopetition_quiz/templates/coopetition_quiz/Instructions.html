        In this part, there will be 10 rounds of decision-making. You will be matched with another participant.
        You will play with the same participant for all 10 rounds.

        <strong><u>Your decision</u></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        In each round, you receive 10 points.
        You need to decide whether to invest these points to an <strong>Investment Account</strong> and a <strong>Rationing Account</strong>,
        or keep these points to yourself.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">

    <p></p>
    <p>That is, you put \(x_1\) points in the <i>Investment Account</i>, \(y_1\) points in the <i>Rationing Account</i>,
        and keep the rest \(10-x_1-y_1\) points; the other participant put \(x_2\) points in the <i>Investment Account</i>, \(y_2\) points in the <i>Rationing Account</i>,
        and keep the rest \(10-x_2-y_2\) points. Your earnings is calculated as follows:</p>

        <li>
            Points in the <i>Investment Account</i> can generate appreciable return,
            which is shared between you and the other participant you are paired with. The size of this total return is:
            $$ \text{Total return} = x_1 x_2 $$
        </li>
        <li>
            Your share of the total return is determined by the points you and the other participant put into the <i>Rationing Account</i>:
            $$ \text{Your share of the total return} =  \frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2} $$
            In case both of you put 0 points in the Rationing Account, the total return will be evenly split between you two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your final earnings can be expressed as
            $$\text{Final Earnings} =  \underbrace{\frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2}x_1 x_2}_{\text{earnings from the investment}} +

        <li>
            Your share of the total return is determined by the points you and the other participant put into the <i>Rationing Account</i>:
            $$ \text{Your share of the total return} =  \frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2} $$

            In case both of you put 0 points in the Rationing Account, the total return will be evenly split between you two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your final earnings can be expressed as
            $$\text{Final Earnings} =  \underbrace{\frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}}_{\text{earnings from the investment}} +
            \underbrace{10-x_1-y_1}_{\text{points kept for oneself}}$$

            Here \(\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}\)
            means that 200 is part of the return only if the random number generated by the computer is less than or equal to \(x_1x_2\).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In general, putting more points in the <i>Investment Account</i> (a higher \(x_1\))
        <strong>makes it more likely to receive a successful investment and a higher total return</strong>
        , while putting more points in the <i>Rationing Account</i> (a higher \(y_1\))  <strong>increases your share of the total return</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, your and the other participant’s earnings can be broken down as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Investment Account</th><th>Rationing Account</th><th>Kept to oneself</th>
            <th>Total Return</th><th>Share of Total Return</th><th>Final Earnings</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>You</th><td>\(x_1\)</td><td>\(y_1\)</td><td>\(10-x_1-y_1\)</td>
            <td rowspan="2">\(\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}\)</td><td> \(\displaystyle \frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2} \)</td>
            <td>\(\displaystyle \frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}+10-x_1-y_1\)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Other</th><td>\(x_2\)</td><td>\(y_2\)</td><td>\(10-x_2-y_2\)</td>
            <td>\(\displaystyle \frac{y_2}{y_1 + y_2} \)</td>
            <td>\(\displaystyle \frac{y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\overbrace{200}^{rand \le x_1x_2}+10-x_1-y_1\)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
