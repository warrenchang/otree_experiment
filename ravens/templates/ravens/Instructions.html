            You will be presented with 10 problems, each showing a pattern with a bit cut out of it.
            Look at the pattern, think what piece is needed to complete the pattern correctly both along the rows and down the columns,
            BUT NOT THE DIAGONALS.
        </p>

        <p >
            You will be paid AED 2 for each correct problem you solve. You have 1 minute to complete each problem.
