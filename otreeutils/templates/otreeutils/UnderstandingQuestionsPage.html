        Please answer the following questions that aim to test your understanding of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you are finished all the questions, you can click "check my answers" button at the bottom to check whether
        your answers are correct. You will not be able to proceed until you correctly answer all questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            If you answer all questions correctly at the first time, you will receive a bonus of AED 10.<br/>
            For each "wrong attempt", that is, each clicking of "check my answers" button with some wrong answers,
            AED 2 would be deducted from the bonus.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have 2 wrong attempts, you will receive AED 6.
        If you have more than 5 wrong attempts, you will not receive any bonus.
    </p>


    <p>If you have already have two wrong attempts and do not understand why your question is wrong,
        you can ask the experimenter for help. </p>
